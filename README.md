## INDEX TO PRACTICALS 

 - PRACTICAL 1 :
    -  Write a program to compute the sum of the first n terms of the following series:
          X = 1 - 1/2^2 + 1/2^3 + 1/2^4 + 1/2^5 .....
    -   The number of terms n is to be taken from the user through the command line. If the
       command line argument is not found then prompt the user to enter the value of n.

- PRACTICAL 2 :
    - Write a program to remove the duplicates from an array

- PRATICAL 3 :
    - Write a program that prints a table indicating the number of occurrences of each
 alphabet in the text entered as command line arguments.

- PRACTICAL 4 :
    - Write a menu driven program to perform string manipulation without using inbuilt
 string functions :
         - Show address of each character in string
         - Concatenate two strings.
         - Compare two strings
         -  Calculate length of the string (use pointers)
         - Convert all lowercase characters to uppercase
         - Reverse the string
         - Insert a string in another string at a user specified position  

- PRACTICAL 5 :
   -  Write a program to merge two ordered arrays to get a single ordered array.

- PRACTICAL 6 :
    -  Write a program to search a given element in a set of N numbers using Binary search
          - with recursion
          - without recursion.
     
- PRACTICAL 7 :
    - Write a program to calculate GCD of two numbers (i) with recursion (ii) without
 recursion.

- PRACTICAL 8 :
    -  Create a Matrix class. Write a menu-driven program to perform following Matrix
 operations (exceptions should be thrown by the functions if matrices passed to them
 are incompatible and handled by the main() function) :
         - Sum
         - Product
         - Transpose

- PRACTICAL 9 :
    - Define a class Person having name as a data member. Inherit two classes Student and
 Employee from Person. Student has additional attributes as course, marks and year
 and Employee has department and salary. Write display() method in all the three
 classes to display the corresponding attributes. Provide the necessary methods to show
 runtime polymorphism.

- PRACTICAL 10 :
    -  Create a Triangle class. Add exception handling statements to ensure the following
 conditions: all sides are greater than 0 and sum of any two sides are greater than the
 third side.
    - The class should also have overloaded functions for calculating the area
 of a right angled triangle as well as using Heron's formula to calculate the area of any
 type of triangle.

- PRACTICAL 11 :
    - Create a class Student containing fields for Roll No., Name, Class, Year and Total
 Marks. Write a program to store 5 objects of Student class in a file. Retrieve these
 records from the file and display them.

- PRACTICAL 12 :
    -  Copy the contents of one text file to another file, after removing all whitespaces.
